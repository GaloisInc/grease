Note [Mark PLT stubs as trusted function entry points]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because we perform incremental code discovery (see Note [Incremental code
discovery] in Grease.Macaw.SimulatorState), we usually do not need to mark any
functions as trusted entry points, since most of the time it suffices to
perform code discovery on a function right after invoking it in macaw. However,
this only works if macaw is able to accurately infer what parts of the binary
are actually functions. As noted in
<https://github.com/GaloisInc/macaw/issues/285>, macaw fails to realize that
PLT stubs are functions when they are entered via tail calls, which in turn
prevents us from applying overrides to these sorts of PLT stubs.

Our workaround to this problem is to simply add all of the PLT stubs for a
particular binary to the set of `trustedFunctionEntryPoints` before running
code discovery. This is sufficient to make code discovery go the extra mile to
analyze each PLT stub and mark them as functions, ensuring that tail calls into
these PLT stubs will work as expected.

If macaw improved its global fixed-point analysis, we might not need this
workaround. See <https://github.com/GaloisInc/macaw/issues/298> for more
details.
