Note [Coping with stack protection]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many C compilers enable -fstack-protector by default, which causes the
generated assembly for certain functions to check for buffer overflows. This
Note describes how grease copes with -fstack-protector–compiled binaries on
each of the currently supported architectures.

-----
-- x86-64 (full support)
-----

x86-64 binaries compiled with -fstack-protector will generate extra code for
protected functions such that:

\* When the function is first invoked, it will load a piece of thread-local
  state via the %fs segment register.

\* Just before the function returns, it will once again load the same
  thread-local state from %fs.

\* It will then check to see if the two thread-local state values are the same.
  If they are equal, then return from the function normally. If they are not
  equal, then this is evidence that a buffer overflow has occurred, so call the
  __stack_chk_fail function (which halts execution).

The tricky part is dealing with %fs. Unlike other x86-64 registers, segment
registers (%fs and %gs) are not modeled as part of the giant register struct
that is passed around during simulation. Instead, reading from segment
registers is handled via the ReadFSBase and ReadGSBase primitive functions in
macaw-x86. By default, macaw-x86-symbolic will crash if it encounters one of
these primitive functions, so it is up to grease to give these primitive
functions meaningful semantics.

One possible approach would be to reverse-engineer the exact shape of the
thread-local state that is accessed in stack-protected functions. This is
doable but tricky to get right, and especially so when you consider that some
of this thread-local state may be compiler-specific.

Instead, we adopt a much simpler approach: initialize all of %fs with a
symbolic array. It doesn't particularly matter /what/ value is stored in %fs so
long as it is equal to itself, and a symbolic array meets that criterion. In
fact, this is exactly the same approach that stubs uses, so we are able to
piggyback on stubs' implementation. (See the relevant comments in
Grease.Macaw.Arch.X86.x86Ctx.)

-----
-- AArch32 (partial support)
-----

The story for AArch32 is similar to that of x86-64, except that instead of
loading a segment register, AArch32 binaries compiled with -fstack-protector
will load the contents of a global variable named __stack_chk_guard. The
details of how __stack_chk_guard materializes at the binary level depend on
whether the binary is statically or dynamically linked.

If the binary is statically linked, then __stack_chk_guard is defined as:

00020450 <__stack_chk_guard>:
   20450:       00000000        andeq   r0, r0, r0

And sure enough, 00000000 equals 00000000, so grease has no issues at all with
this. (In reality, the binary's startup code would modify the value of
__stack_chk_guard before calling the main() function, but we don't model the
startup code. Nor do we particularly need to for this example to work out.)

Unfortunately, life is harder when dealing with dynamically linked binaries, as
__stack_chk_guard is referenced indirectly via an R_ARM_COPY or R_ARM_GLOB_DAT
relocation. grease does not yet model the semantics of these relocation types
in full fidelity (see #22). Instead, it will populate the part of the binary
where __stack_chk_guard's relocation resides with symbolic bytes. grease will
then attempt to interpret these symbolic bytes as a pointer and read from it,
but this will fail.

If we wanted to support stack protection in dynamically linked AArch32
binaries, we could consider special-casing the code that populates
__stack_chk_guard's relocation region so that it populates it with a dummy
pointer value that points to something valid.

-----
-- PowerPC (no support)
-----

grease currently does not support stack protection on PowerPC at all.

More specifically, PowerPC binaries compiled with -fstack-protector will
attempt to access a piece of thread-local state via r2 (the table of contents
register) at an extremely large offset (e.g., -28680). This does not play well
with grease's heuristics, which will attempt to allocate space for r2 one byte
at a time, causing the refinement loop to time out well before it ever
allocates enough space to cover the large offset. If we want to support this,
we will likely need to give r2 a pre-determined PtrShape that allocates this
space ahead of time, similarly to how we deal with the stack pointer register.

-----

Regardless of which architecture is used, the stack protection code will call
out to the __stack_chk_fail function in the event of a buffer overflow.
Usually, the call to __stack_chk_fail is guarded behind a symbolic equality
check, so grease will usually simulate the definition of __stack_chk_fail (even
if the SMT solver ultimately concludes that the path condition leading up to
calling __stack_chk_fail is unsatisfiable). Unfortunately, the definition of
__stack_chk_fail is usually too gnarly for Macaw to handle. For instance, the
x86-64 version of __stack_chk_fail invokes the `hlt` instruction, which
macaw-x86-symbolic does not have semantics for.

As such, we install an override for __stack_chk_fail that simply calls the
abort() function, which grease can handle without issue. Actually, to be more
precise, we install this as an override for both __stack_chk_fail and its
cousin, the __stack_chk_fail_local function. There are two reasons for this:

\* On PowerPC, __stack_chk_fail_local is an entirely separate function that is
  defined in terms of __stack_chk_fail. We could try to simulate the definition
  of __stack_chk_fail_local, but there's not much reason to.

\* On x86-64 and AArch32, __stack_chk_fail_local is a weak alias for the
  __stack_chk_fail function, and both functions are defined at the same
  address. Due to a quirk in how macaw-loader works, however (see
  https://github.com/GaloisInc/macaw-loader/issues/25), the override will apply
  to __stack_chk_fail_local, /not/ __stack_chk_fail. As such, it is convenient
  to override both functions just in case.
