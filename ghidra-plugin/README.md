# GREASE Ghidra Batch Plugin

This [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) plugin adds an analysis called "GREASE Analysis" which runs GREASE on all functions in a binary. Documentation can be found in the [GREASE book documentation](https://galoisinc.github.io/grease/ghidra-batch-plugin.html).
